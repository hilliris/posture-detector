# posture-detector

To-Do List:

1. Figure out how to access positional data of joints/body parts
2. Write some program that logically determines if a person is slouching using the positional
data returned from the model (waist up/hip)
3. Have the program tell you to stop slouching (sit up straigher)
- if we're running this on a single photo the program will just tell you if you're slouching
or not
- if we're using a webcam the program will tell you to straighten up until your posture is good >:)
